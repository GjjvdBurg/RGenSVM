  New submission

  Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    GenSVM (8:18, 10:61, 15:2, 16:26, 19:11)
    Multiclass (4:22)
    SVMs (14:25, 15:42)
    misclassifications (11:49)
    multiclass (8:53, 14:14, 15:31)


  This is a new submission and these words are not mis-spelled, just not in 
  the dictionary.
